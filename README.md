## 0. Before you start
As a member of the DBL, your project will have a **project ID** that looks like `DBL123` (e.g. *DBL046*).  
Ask your supervisor to find out what your project ID is.  

Once you have access to [DTU's HPC](https://www.hpc.dtu.dk/?page_id=497), login to the HPC. This is your **home folder**.  

1. Access HPC.  
2. Inside your home directory, create a **work directory** named after your `projectID_nameID` (e.g. `DBL046_johndoe`).  
   This is the folder where you‚Äôll be working from now on.  

Example:
```bash
cd ~
mkdir DBL046_johndoe
cd DBL046_johndoe
```
